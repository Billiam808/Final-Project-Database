This is the final project I made for my Database class.<br>
First, I had to create a schema constructs based on what the customer had explained to us.<br>
Second, I had to normalize the constructs<br>
Third part of the project was to create an EER Diagram of the database<br>
Finally, I implemented the database using phpmyadmin to host my database<br>
then, used php and html to output the data.<br>
<br>
I blocked out all the passwords in the files in this repository.
